                    <h2>Here's a Timeline of Jesus Christ's life</h2>

                    <hr>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Annunciation (6 B.C.)</b> <br>
                            Some time before Jesus' birth the angel Gabriel visited Mary and told her that she was going to have a very special baby.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Birth (6 B.C.)</b><br>
                            Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judea. According to the Gospels, Jesus was not the son of Joseph in the ordinary sense. He was miraculously conceived by Mary through God, without any human father. That is why Christians say that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born to the Virgin Mary.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Visited by the Magi (5 B.C.)</b><br>
                            The Bible tells us how the Magi (wisemen/priests with supernatural powers from ancient Persia) from the East brought presents to the infant Christ. They seemed to know that something quite out of ordinary had happened.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Visit to the Temple as a Boy (7 A.D.)</b><br>
                            According to the Gospels, at age 12 Jesus made a visit with his parents to Jerusalem during the feast of the Passover. St. Luke tells us how suddenly he disappeared and eventually his parents found him in the Temple where, to their great astonishment he was holding a serious conversation with learned men that were astonished by his wisdom.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Baptized (26 A.D.)</b><br>
                            Jesus must have been around 30 years old when he met a man called John the Baptist, who had started a religious movement preparing for the coming of the Messiah, or saviour. Jesus was baptized by John in the River Jordan.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Messiah (26 A.D.)</b><br>	
                            After Jesus was Baptized by John the Baptist, he took part in John's religious movement and became convinced that it was himself whom God intended to be the Messiah.</li><br>
                        <li><b>The First Miracle (26 A.D.)</b><br>	
                        During the first part of his ministry Jesus made tours from his base at Capernaum in Galilee to the neighboring towns and villages, proving the authority of his mission by performing miraculous deeds. The Gospels describe various miracles, such as raising the dead, casting out devils, healing the sick, calming the waves and winds by command, and other wonderful deeds.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Jesus chooses The 12 Diciples (28 A.D.)</b><br>
                            Jesus had chosen a little group of 12 disciples, or followers called apostles, to help him in his work. He began to give them special teaching and shared with them some of his own deepest religious experiences so that they could understand fully who he was.</li><br>
                        <li><b>The Last Supper (30 A.D.)</b><br>
                            Jesus left Galilee and returned to Jerusalem. Soon, he realized that his teachings had aroused opposition. Worse still, he knew that one of his own disciples was turning against him. Jesus knew that the danger was great, and he must prepare for the end. He gathered his 12 disciples together for a final meal, Known as the Last Supper, and explained to them that his death was necessary because it would establish a new covenant between God and man, and it would be the disciples' duty to spread Jesus' teachings after he had gone. He took bread and wine, blessed it and gave it to his disciples saying, "This is my body...this is my blood". Christians remember this when they celebrate Holy Communion.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Arrest and Trial (30 A.D.)</b><br>
                            After the meal, Jesus and the disciples went to Mount of Olives, a hill on the east side of Jerusalem. That is the place where Judas Iscariot brought man to arrest Jesus. They took him to the Jewish leaders for trial. The High Priest asked Jesus, "Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed, and Jesus replied, "I am". Consequently, he was sentenced to death. The sentence the Jewish leaders had passed could not be carried out until it had been approved by the Roman governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate. Pilate was uncertain what to do and after consulting the crowd he gave in and sentenced Jesus to be crucified (this was the Roman method of executing criminals by nailing them to a cross).</li><br>
                        <li><b>Crucifixion and Death (30 A.D.)</b><br>
                            Jesus was crucified between two convicted thieves and died six hours later. During this time, the soldiers affixed a sign to the top of the cross stating "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews". After Jesus' death, one soldier pierced his side with a spear to be certain that he had died, then blood and water gushed. The Bible describes seven statements that Jesus made while he was on the cross, as well as several supernatural events that occurred. Collectively referred to as the Passion (from Latin: suffering), Jesus' suffering and redemptive death by crucifixion are the central aspects of Christian theology concerning the doctrines of salvation and atonement.</li><br>
                        <li><b>Resurrection (30 A.D.)</b><br>
                            That evening (Friday) the dead body of Jesus was taken down from the cross and laid in a tomb, and a great stone was rolled across the entrance of the tomb. Early on the Sunday morning, Easter Sunday, a group of women disciples went to the tomb and found the stone rolled back and the body gone. Soon after this discovery Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene (a Jewish woman, one of Jesus' followers, was a witness to his crucifixion, burial, and resurrection) and to the disciples, and the news quickly spread that Jesus returned from the dead. Jesus' resurrection is a matter of great importance for Christians, for the Christian faith is based on the resurrection of Christ.</li><br>

                    <h3><i>"When you think of it, really there are four fundamental questions of life. You’ve asked them, I’ve asked them, every thinking person asks them. They boil down to this; origin, meaning, morality and destiny. ‘How did I come into being? What brings life meaning? How do I know right from wrong? Where am I headed after I die? Only Jesus answers these four questions rationally"<br> - Ravi Zacharias </i></h3>
